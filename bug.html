I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, despite being correctly included in my HTML and CSS files.  I checked my CSS file to ensure Tailwind's styles were being included (using @tailwind directives), checked for typos in my class names and ensured that I was using the correct version of Tailwind.  The problem was inconsistent and sporadic, appearing only on specific elements or under particular circumstances.
