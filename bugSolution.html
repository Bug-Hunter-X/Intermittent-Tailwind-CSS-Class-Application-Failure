The solution involved carefully reviewing the project's CSS and JavaScript for any potential conflicts or interference with Tailwind CSS's class application. In this specific case, a rogue stylesheet was overriding Tailwind styles for specific elements. Removing or modifying that conflicting stylesheet resolved the issue.  To prevent this, carefully organize your CSS files and ensure there are no conflicting selectors that inadvertently override Tailwind classes.  Furthermore, consider using the `!important` flag judiciously only if absolutely necessary for overriding styles, as overuse can lead to difficult-to-maintain code.
