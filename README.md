# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to HTML elements. The issue is intermittent and seemingly random, making it difficult to debug.  The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a potential solution.

## Problem Description

Classes defined in the Tailwind CSS configuration file are not always rendering on the HTML elements, even when they appear correct syntactically.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

* Verified that the Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind directives`) are correctly included in the CSS file.
* Double-checked for typos or inconsistencies in class names.
* Confirmed that the correct version of Tailwind CSS is installed and configured.
* Checked for conflicting CSS rules that could override Tailwind's classes.

## Potential Solution

This issue may be resolved by ensuring there are no conflicting stylesheets or JavaScript interfering with Tailwind's application. In more complex scenarios, rebuilding the CSS may be necessary.
